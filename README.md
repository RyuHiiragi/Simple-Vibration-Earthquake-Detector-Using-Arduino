# Simple Vibration/Earthquake Detector Using Arduino

This repository contains the Arduino code, configuration, and assembly instructions for building a simple vibration/earthquake detector using an accelerometer sensor. The system is designed to detect vibrations or small seismic activities, which can serve as an early warning system for potential earthquakes <button class="citation-flag" data-index="1">. It is ideal for educational purposes, home safety, or small-scale monitoring applications.

## Overview
The vibration/earthquake detector uses an MPU6050 accelerometer to measure acceleration and tilt, detecting vibrations caused by seismic activity <button class="citation-flag" data-index="8">. When a significant vibration is detected, the system triggers an audible alert (buzzer) and visual indicators (LEDs). This project is a simple yet effective way to monitor for potential earthquakes or structural vibrations.

## Components Used
To build this vibration/earthquake detector, you will need the following components:
- **Arduino Uno**
- **MPU6050 Accelerometer/Gyroscope**
- **Active Buzzer**
- **Red LED**
- **Green LED**
- **220Î© Resistors**
- **Jumper Wires**
- **Breadboard (Optional)**

## System Dimensions
For an ideal vibration/earthquake detector:
- **Height**: 10â€“15 cm
- **Width**: 10â€“15 cm
- **Length**: 10â€“15 cm

These dimensions ensure that the system is compact yet spacious enough to house all components.

## Assembly Instructions
Follow these steps to assemble your vibration/earthquake detector:
1. Connect the MPU6050 sensor to the Arduino using I2C communication.
2. Connect the buzzer and LEDs to the appropriate digital pins on the Arduino.
3. Power the system using a USB cable or 9V battery.
4. Secure all components inside a protective enclosure.

---

## Arduino Code Explanation
The provided Arduino code reads data from the MPU6050 sensor and calculates the total acceleration. If the acceleration exceeds a predefined threshold, the system triggers an alert by activating the buzzer and lighting up the red LED. During normal conditions, the green LED remains lit.

## How to Test Without Simulation
1. Upload the code to the Arduino using a USB cable.
2. Test the accelerometer by shaking it gently and observing the Serial Monitor for vibration messages.
3. Verify that the buzzer and LEDs respond correctly to detected vibrations.
